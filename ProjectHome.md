## Dec 27, 2011: Junto has now moved to Github (https://github.com/parthatalukdar/junto) ##



This toolkit consists of implementations of various graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms. Currently, three algorithms are implemented: Gaussian Random Fields (GRF), Adsorption, and Modified Adsorption (MAD).

Starting with v1.2.0, Junto also contains Hadoop-based implementations of these three algorithms.

**Why is the toolkit named Junto?**
The core code was written while Partha Talukdar was at the University of Pennsylvania, and Ben Franklin (the founder of the University) established a club called Junto that provided a structured forum for him and his friends to debate and exchange knowledge:

This has a nice parallel with how label propagation works: nodes are connected and influence each other based on their connections. Also "junto" means "along" and "together" in a number of Latin languages, and carries the connotation of cooperation---also a good fit for label propagation.
